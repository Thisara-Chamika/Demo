                Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of
                Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's
                crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.
                Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar
                deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust
                consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
                earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the
                destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.</p>

                <p class="para">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,
                    heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as
                    visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of
                    energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central
                    subject for astronomical research since antiquity.</p>

                    times the diameter of Earth. Tidal forces between Earth and the Moon have over time synchronized the Moon's
                    orbital period (lunar month) with its rotation period (lunar day) at 29.5 Earth days, causing the same side of
                    the Moon to always face Earth. The Moon's gravitational pull and to a lesser extent, the Sun's are the main
                    drivers of Earth's tides.</p>

                    all of
                    Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2%

                    crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land
                    hemisphere.
                    Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at
                    Earth's polar
                    deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined.
                    Earth's crust
                    consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
                    earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most
                    of the
